# stock-analysis

## Project Overview

  The purpose of this stock analysis was to refactor the code of Steveâ€™s parents stock analysis workbook to determine if stocks found in the 2017 and 2018 workbook are worth investing in. The refactored code should run more efficiently, assuming refactoring code will clean the data and result in a more efficient outcome time.

## Results

  When we refactor code, we can see the pros and cons of the speed of our code. The cleaner the code or the more organized the code is written, the quicker the program will run. As code becomes messy, then the higher the chances of error and debugging. Sometimes code may not be able to be refactored due to size. It is also important to remember that if code is refactored, there may be chance the results of the original code may be altered. With this workbook we saw a decrease in time from the original code to the refactored code, which means the refactored code ran more efficiently than the original working code.

We can clearly see the code ran more efficiently with the quicker run time

## Summary

  Refactoring code helps other code readers to easily read the code as well as for the code to run more efficiently. For this workbook, the code took just under a second to run; however, once we refactored the code, the efficiency was clear, and the code ran at about half a second. Now granted, at an inefficient level the code only took a second.. With large financial firms or in a working environment with large amounts of data, the cleaner the code, the quicker the results of the code will show which is why code should be clean and in its simplest form so coders and program readers can determine the results faster. That measily second the program reader took to read this code could turn into minutes or hours reading extraneous amounts of code. The importance of clean code is clear on this small scale workbook.
